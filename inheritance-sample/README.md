## Intro

Some simple tests with a classic vehicle, car, plane, flying car vehicle, implemented both using OOP/Composition and mixins.

## Setup

```
gem install rspec
```

## Tests

Run them separately as they have same names and would cause collisions when doing requires
```
rspec spec/mixins_spec.rb
rspec spec/oop_spec.rb
```
